Sypher's Recommended Melee Ruleset

Revision 1, April 2023



# Equipment
(WIP)

# In-game Rules
- 4 stock matches
- 8 minute time limit
- Item frequency will be set to NONE
- Team Attack will be ON
- Pause will be set to OFF

# Major Out-of-game Rules
- Sets by default will be played best 2 out of 3. Tournament finals (losers/winners bracket, grands) will be played best 3 out of 5. In large enough brackets, more rounds may be played best 3 out of 5.
- At the beginning of each set, players will determine port priority by coin flip. The winner will take port priority and the loser will decide who begins the stage striking. The ports used will be dependent on the stage chosen, as described in this document.
- If the timer in a match reaches zero, the match winner will be decided by the following:
  - The player who has not exceeded the ledge grab limit (LGL) of 60. The number of ledge grabs can be inspected in the post-match statistics under Cliffhangers.
  - If neither player has exceeded the LGL, or both players have exceeded the LGL, the winner will be determined by lives and then percent.
  - If both players had the same percent at time up, the match will be replayed in full on the same stage.
  - In the extreme condition that the match must be replayed a second time, a default victory will instead be given to the player with port priority (P1>P2>P3>P4).
- Wobbling is banned in singles only. Pummeling more than three times with the primary Ice Climber while the secondary Ice Climber is still alive is considered a violation of this ban. If the secondary Ice Climber is dead (as defined by the game state), there is no pummel restriction.
- Mid-match and mid-set coaching is illegal and will result in the coach and the coached party being disqualified.

# Minor Out-of-game Rules
- Master Hand is banned.
- If the stock icon glitch is used, the player must announce their character.
- In between games of a set, a player may call for a TO to enforce a 1 minute time limit. After 1 minute has passed, players will have 15 seconds to make each counterpicking decision. Players must ban and select a stage, and counterpick characters in accordance with the rules. If either player is unable to make a decision within the time limit they may face a game loss. The TO will use their discretion in case of emergencies. This time limit will only be enforced while a TO or staff member mediates this process.
- Players may request a change in colors to accommodate either for colorblindness or for difficulty distinguishing characters from each other or from the stage background. Ideally this should be done before loading the stage, but can be requested any time before characters have interacted with one
another (dealt damage) during the match. In the case of a disagreement, the TO will be the deciding authority.
- Pausing during an ongoing match will generally be considered a match forfeiture. In extreme cases, the TO may decide alternative consequences are appropriate.
- Glitches and tactics used to indefinitely forfeit the opponent's control or to indefinitely stall a match are banned. Ex: IC Freeze Glitch, Mewtwo Soul Stunner, etc. | wall-bombing, rising pound, etc.


# Round Robin Placements
- If the round robin does not involve limited promotion to another bracket or event, tied placements will be combined and awarded evenly.
- In the case that round robin pools must promote a limited number of participants to a later series, ties will be broken in the following order:
  - Head-to-head record
  - Win percentage
  - Result of a smaller round robin among participants still tied


# Melee Stage Information
## Frozen Pokemon Stadium & Yoshi’s Story
With the accessibility of tools such as 20XXTE, it is completely possible for almost every Melee tournament to disable stage hazards. The fire and rock transformations on Pokémon Stadium are specifically so intrusive that the game is sometimes effectively paused during the transformation. While a rare occurrence, Fly Guys on Yoshi’s Story can also have a dramatic impact on the match, and are frequently not within the view of the game camera. Unity will opt to run a ruleset specifically disabling these stage hazards. In order to disable stage hazards while using 20XXTE, press the Y button on the stage select screen. The selection cursor and stage text will change from white to blue, indicating that frozen stage mode is activated.


## Port Priority
Port priority is defined such that the first controller slot has a higher priority than the second slot, which has a higher priority than the third slot, etc.

## Neutral Start Port Selection
Players must play their singles matches using the following controller ports to ensure a neutral start. If using 20XXTE, enabling the neutral start option will take care of this procedure for you, allowing any ports to be used. If possible, it is preferred to utilize the 20XXTE functionality. 


Stage Port 1 Port 2 Port 3 Port 4
Dream Land 64 Player 1 Player 2
Battlefield Player 1 Player 2
Final Destination Player 1 Player 2
Pokémon Stadium Player 1 Player 2
Yoshi’s Story Player 1 Player 2
Fountain of Dreams Player 1 Player 2

# Melee Set Procedure
## Port Priority
- A coin flip (or other sufficiently random method) will determine port priority, given to the winner. Port priority is to be held for the rest of the set. Lower port priority will decide who strikes first. The controller slots to be used are determined by the stage, as covered in the Stage Information section of this document.
## Double-Blind Character Selection
- Players reserve the right to call for a double-blind character pick for the first match of any set.
- If a double-blind pick is called, players will secretly tell their character pick to a TO or staff member, and select their characters after both choices have been made.
- Alternatively, double-blind picking can be done by writing down their character selections on paper, and then exchanging the papers before selecting the characters in-game.
## Stage Striking
- The player with lower port priority will decide who strikes first.
- The first striking player strikes one stage, the second player strikes two stages, and the first player strikes once again, leaving one stage remaining.
- The first match will then be played on the remaining stage.
## Advanced Slob Picks
- In a best of 3 set, the winner of the preceding match will pick a stage and ban the opponent from counterpicking that stage.
- In a best of 5 set, there are no stage bans.
- The loser of the previous match then selects a stage for the next match to be played on, from the list of all legal stages, excluding the banned stage and stages that fall under Dave’s Stupid Rule.
- After the next stage has been decided, the winner of the preceding match selects his character.
- After the winner of the preceding match selects his character, the loser of the preceding match picks his character.
## Dave’s Stupid Rule (DSR)
- If a player has won on a stage, that stage may not be counterpicked by that player for the rest of the set.

## Final Notes
- After counterpicking, players play on the selected stage. Afterwards, this counterpicking process repeats
until a player has won enough matches to win the set.
- Striking has no effect on banning. You may counterpick stages that were struck at the beginning of the set.
- You may counterpick a stage you have previously banned.
- This process starts over at the beginning of a new set, regardless of the players having played before.
